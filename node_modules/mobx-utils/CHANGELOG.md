# 4.0.1

* passing a `fromPromise` based promise to `fromPromise` no longer throws an exception. Fixes [#119](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-utils/issues/119)
* added viewModel `resetProperty` to typescript typings, fixes [#117](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-utils/issues/117) through [#118](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-utils/pull/118) by @navidjh
* Added `moveItem(array, fromIndex, toIndex)` utility, as replacement for the dropped `ObservableArray.move` in MobX 4. Trough [#121](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-utils/pull/121) by @jeffijoe
* Fixed incorrect peer dependency, [#115](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-utils/pull/115) by @xaviergonz

# 4.0.0

Updated mobx-utils to use MobX 4. No futher changes

# 3.2.2

* `toStream` now accepts a second argument, `fireImmediately=false`, which, when `true`, immediately pushes the current value to the stream. Fixes [#82](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-utils/issues/82)

# 3.2.1

* Fixed issue where `whenAsync` was not exposed correctly.
* Added `timeout` parameter to `whenAsync`

# 3.2.0

* Switched to rollup for bundling, bundle non-minified and include a es module based build. See [#81](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-utils/pull/81) by [@mijay](https://github.com/mijay)

# 3.1.1
* Introduced `whenAsync`, which is like normal `when`, except that this `when` will return a promise that resolves when the expression becomes truthy. See #66 and #68, by @daedalus28

# 3.0.0

### Revamped `fromPromise`:

* It is now possible to directly pass a `(resolve, reject) => {}` function to `fromPromise`, instead of a promise object
* **BREAKING** `fromPromise` no longer creates a wrapping object, but rather extends the given promise, #45
* **BREAKING** Fixed #54, the resolved value of a promise is no longer deeply converted to an observable
* **BREAKING** Dropped `fromPromise().reason`
* **BREAKING** Improved typings of `fromPromise`. For example, the `value` property is now only available if `.state === "resolved"` (#41)
* **BREAKING** Dropped optional `initialvalue` param from `fromPromise`. use `fromPromise.fullfilled(value)` instead to create a promise in some ready state
* Introduced `fromPromise.reject(reason)` and `fromPromise.resolve(value?)` to create a promise based observable in a certain state, see #39
* Fixed #56, observable promises attributes `state` and `value` are now explicit observables

### Introduced `asyncAction`

See the [docs](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-utils#asyncaction) for details, but the gist of it:

```javascript
import {asyncAction} from "mobx-utils"

mobx.configure({ enforceActions: true }) // don't allow state modifications outside actions

class Store {
	@observable githubProjects = []
	@state = "pending" // "pending" / "done" / "error"

	@asyncAction
	*fetchProjects() { // <- note the star, this a generator function!
		this.githubProjects = []
		this.state = "pending"
		try {
			const projects = yield fetchGithubProjectsSomehow() // yield instead of await
			const filteredProjects = somePreprocessing(projects)
			// the asynchronous blocks will automatically be wrapped actions
			this.state = "done"
			this.githubProjects = filteredProjects
		} catch (error) {
			this.state = "error"
		}
	}
}
```
